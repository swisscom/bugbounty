Introduction
------------
Tiago Caetano Henriques discovered a security flaw in D-link DIR-636L router
that enables an attacker on the same network to execute arbitrary commands
without being authenticated.


Vulnerable
----------
D-Link DIR-636L and possibly other versions as seen on [1].


Patches
-------
None existant at the moment.


Description
-----------
The D-Link DIR636L (possibly others) incorrectly filters input on the 'ping'
tool which allows to inject arbitrary commands into the router. Secondly,
authentication is not being  performed correctly. This enables a remote
attacker to gain full control of the router, for example to attack other
networks in a DDoS style attack, or even expose computers behind these devices
to the internet as you are able to change firewall/nat rules on this router.


Attack vector
-------------
A URL encoded POST request with the values in front of ping_addr= such as the
following, will go through and will execute the command in front of &.
POST /ping.ccp HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.1
...
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: http://192.168.0.1/tools_vct.asp
