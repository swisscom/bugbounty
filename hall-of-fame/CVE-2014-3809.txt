Introduction:
-------------
Swisscom CSIRT discovered a security flaw in the management interface
of the Alcatel Lucent 1830 Photonic Service Switch series.


Vulnerable:
-----------
All Switches of Release 6.0 or lower are vulnerable.


Patches:
--------
None.


Description:
------------
The management interface of the 1830 Photonic Switch series is vulnerable
to reflected cross-site scripting, since user input is not properly encoded
on output. Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to so-called cross-site
scripting (XSS) and allows the impersonation of logged-in admin users.
Additionally, the myurl-Parameter accepts non-local web addresses, which
can be abused to redirect victims to arbitrary web sites.


Attack vector:
--------------
https://xx.xx.xx.xx/menu/pop.html?myurl=);<script>alert('xss')</script>


Statement Vendor:
-----------------
"The vulnerability is assessed at no risk. We will evaluate if/when we
will add the best practice of validating all inputs in WebUI tasks, but
this is not considered high priority for the roadmap."
