Description
-----------
A vulnerability has been discovered in the TR069 protocol that can potentially
affect all Automatic Configuration Servers (ACS). The issue has been fixed in
the Home Device Manager (HDM) product from Alcatel-Lucent with an anti-spoofing
filter.  HDM allows service providers to remotely manage CPEs, such as
residential gateways, IP set-top boxes, and VoIP terminal adapters that comprise
a home networking environment.
 
 
Product
-------
Alcatel-Lucent Home Device Manager, version prior to 4.1.10 may be affected if
they have no filtering in place, which was provided as a customer specific
extension already by Alcatel-Lucent, or have foreseen other additional
authorization checks.
 
 
Vulnerability
-------------
The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform impersonation attacks by
spoofing CPE using tr-069 (cwmp) Protocol. An attacker could gain unauthorized
access to third-party SIP Credentials for the spoofed device and perform illegal
activities (phone fraud). The vulnerability has been tested and confirmed.
 
 
Remediation
----------- 
Update to Home Device Manager Version 4.1.10 (or higher) or 4.2.2 (or higher)
and activate the anti-spoofing filters, in case there is not already a customer
specific filter or authorization check in place.
